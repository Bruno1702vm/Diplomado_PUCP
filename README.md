## üìñ Course Overview
This course covers the essential elements for developing programming skills with Python, with a focus on incorporating Python as a toolkit for quantitative research in the social sciences. The course emphasizes data handling and lays the foundation for training students in data science.  

Students will learn basic programming concepts such as data structures, defining functions, and working with essential data analysis libraries, especially **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

---

## üéØ Course Description
This course is designed for students and professionals in the social sciences with no prior experience in programming languages, or those who have just started using statistical software such as Stata and are interested in working with data through code.  

The main goal is to prepare students for the job market by providing a highly demanded skill that serves as preparation for an entry-level position or internship involving data science.

---

## üéì Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Interact with Python through **Jupyter Notebooks** and use **Markdown** effectively.
- Write code to perform common data analysis tasks.
- Work autonomously with Python tools for data science in their research and professional roles.
